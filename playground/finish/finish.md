## Congratulations!

You have completed the **Istio Playground** scenario.

## What You Explored

- The Istio service mesh environment with full control plane and data plane components
- Freely creating, modifying, and deleting Istio resources without guided steps
- How different Istio subsystems (traffic management, security, observability) interact in a live cluster
- Using `kubectl` and `istioctl` together to inspect mesh state and diagnose issues

## Key Istio Resources Available

- `VirtualService`, `DestinationRule`, `Gateway` — traffic management primitives
- `PeerAuthentication`, `AuthorizationPolicy`, `RequestAuthentication` — security policies
- `ServiceEntry`, `WorkloadEntry` — external and non-Kubernetes service registration
- `istioctl analyze`, `istioctl proxy-config`, `istioctl proxy-status` — debugging and validation tools

## Next Steps

- Work through the structured scenarios for in-depth coverage of each Istio feature area
- **Traffic Management** — request routing, traffic shifting, circuit breaking, mirroring
- **Security** — mTLS, HTTP authorization, JWT-based authorization
- **Ingress and Egress** — control traffic entering and leaving your mesh
- Explore the full [Istio task library](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/) for hands-on guides
