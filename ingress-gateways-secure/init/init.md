In this scenario, you will practice configuring Istio to secure ingress traffic by using an ingress Gateway resource.

A secure ingress Gateway serves the purpose of exposing a service beyond the boundaries of the service mesh over HTTPs/TLS.

You will also extend the Gateway resource configuration to support **mutual TLS** between the server and the client.
